# pharmacy-project

## Basics
- SPA developed by using React
- Online pharmacy website, where you can order products

## What I used
- Most of the code is written using React
- For the design I used a combination of Bootstrap and CSS
- Communicating with a server deployed in Render using REST Api

## Admin profile
- In order to see the orders or create a new product you must be logged in as the admin
